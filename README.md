# Movie Idea: DROP

## "Some classes you drop. Some classes drop you."

---

### Synopsis

A veteran, overly-confident college student, known for their "strategic course adjustments," dispenses wisdom on the delicate art of dropping a class to a nervous underclassman. Their advice quickly devolves into a dramatic, slightly embellished recount of their most infamous drop experience â€“ a saga involving a mysterious prerequisite, a professor who communicates solely through interpretive dance, and a near-death encounter with the Registrar's office coffee machine. It's a comedic look at student life, bureaucracy, and the sheer panic of realizing you've accidentally enrolled in "Advanced Underwater Basket Weaving II: Knot Theory for the Existentially Troubled."

### Characters

   The Narrator (Max/Maya): Popular, charismatic, claims vast experience in navigating campus life, especially the parts involving minimal effort and strategic withdrawal. Their confidence often outweighs their actual competence, leading to hilarious self-inflicted wounds. Thinks dropping a class is a competitive sport they are winning.
   The Rookie (Sam/Sidney): Wide-eyed underclassman, overwhelmed by the system, utterly terrified of making a mistake, particularly dropping a class. Views the Narrator as a guru, until they hear the full, terrifying truth.

### The Scene

The campus quad. Sun is shining. Birds are singing. Everything is idyllic, except for the look of pure panic on Sam's face as they clutch a crumpled add/drop form. Max leans against a tree, looking impossibly cool, nursing a suspiciously non-coffee beverage.


Max: Alright, rookie. Deep breaths. You look like you've just seen the dining hall meatloaf on a Tuesday.

Sam: (Hyperventilating) It's the form, Max! I have to drop Intro to Modern Sloth Studies! I thought it was about napping! It's about actual, slow-moving sloths and their complex socio-political structures!

Max: Ah, yes. The Dreaded Drop. A classic student rite of passage. Don't sweat it, kid. You're talking to a black belt in dropping. I've dropped classes you haven't even heard of. Classes they invented just so I could drop them.

Sam: But... how? Is it hard? Will they judge me? Will my GPA spontaneously combust? Will I be forever branded a quitter?

Max: Whoa, slow down, turbo. Judgment? Please. The university runs on students dropping classes. It's practically their economic model. Think of it as... strategic repositioning. Course correction. A tactical retreat! It's less 'quitting,' more 'not actively pursuing something that will make you cry into your textbook at 3 AM.'

Sam: Okay... okay. So, how do you do it? What's the trick?

Max: The trick, my friend, is finesse. And knowing who to avoid. Let me tell you about the Great Thermodynamics Drop of '22. That, Sam, was a masterpiece of strategic non-engagement. Or, well, a total chaotic dumpster fire that I somehow survived and now portray as a masterclass. Tomato, tomahto.

### The Anecdote: The Great Thermodynamics Drop of '22

#### The Class From Heck


Max (V.O.): It was Fall '22. I needed one more science credit. Thermodynamics of Existential Dread seemed... intriguing. Sounded deep. Turns out it was just regular thermodynamics, but taught by Professor Albrecht.


> "Professor Albrecht didn't lecture. He... gestured. Like a very angry, avant-garde mime explaining the second law of thermodynamics using only interpretive dance and the occasional guttural sigh."


Max: The first two weeks were a blur of confused arm-waving and equations that looked like ancient alien script. I thought maybe it was an advanced learning technique. Maybe I was just too linear in my thinking! Then came the first problem set. It involved calculating the entropy change of a single tear rolling down your cheek while contemplating the heat death of the universe. I knew then. I had to drop.


#### The Bureaucratic Gauntlet


Max: Now, you'd think dropping a class is simple, right? Click a button? Fill out a form? Hah! Not this university! It's a quest! A dungeon crawl! First, you need the fabled 'Request for Course Adjustment Due to Existential Mismatch' form. It's printed on a paper only available in the Bursar's office basement on Tuesdays between 2:07 PM and 2:11 PM, but only if Jupiter is in retrograde. I finally found it behind a filing cabinet labeled 'Lost Hopes & Dreams.'

Sam: That... sounds specific.

Max: Oh, it gets better. You need signatures. Three of them! Your advisor (a creature of myth and legend you can only schedule a meeting with via carrier pigeon), the department head (who is perpetually on sabbatical in Bhutan), and, the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance... the professor themselves.


#### The Advisor's Lair


Max (V.O.): My advisor, Professor Higgins, lived in an office piled floor-to-ceiling with unsorted papers. Entering felt like venturing into a paper labyrinth.



Max: (To Sam) I finally got to Higgins' office. The air was thick with the scent of old coffee and despair. I presented the form. He squinted at it over glasses perched precariously on his nose.

Professor Higgins: (Voice like dry leaves) 'Thermodynamics of Existential Dread,' you say? Excellent course. Why drop? Not contemplating the void with sufficient rigor?

Max: Uh, well, sir, it's less the void and more... the interpretive dance? And the lack of, you know, actual lecturing?

Professor Higgins: (Sighs, stamps the form with a rubber chicken stamp) Art is subjective, Mr....? (Checks form)... Ah, Max. Just get Albrecht's signature. And try not to touch the coffee machine on your way out. It's... sentient.


#### The Glorious Escape (Sort Of)


Max (V.O.): Getting Albrecht's signature was the final boss battle. I had to catch him after class. As the other students fled, I approached the podium. He just... stared. Expressively. With his arms.



Max: Professor Albrecht? Sir? I, uh, need your signature to drop your class? It's... not a reflection on your excellent... kinetic oration?

(Max mimes interpretive dance. Albrecht responds with a rapid series of hand gestures that Max interprets as "Are you mocking my art?" followed by a sharp clap.)

Max: (Panicked) No! No, sir! It's me! I'm the problem! My brain is too... rigid! Needs more... flow!

(Max performs a truly terrible, flailing interpretive dance of 'dropping a class'. Albrecht watches, stone-faced, then slowly, dramatically, reaches for the form. He signs it with a flourish that looks like a tiny, angry bird.)

Max: (To Sam) I snatched the form, muttered thanks, and practically ran. But as I passed the Registrar's office, heart pounding with victory, I remembered Higgins' warning about the coffee machine. Distracted, I tripped. The form... the precious, signed form... fluttered... towards...



Max: ...the sentient coffee machine. Which chose that exact moment to erupt, spraying lukewarm, week-old coffee everywhere! The form was ruined! A soggy mess!


> "My masterpiece of strategic non-engagement had become... abstract coffee art."


Max: I had to scramble, reprint the form, track down everyone again â€“ dodging the now actively hostile coffee machine. It took three more days and a minor incident involving a pigeon and a misplaced stapler.


---

### Back to Reality


Max: (Finishes story, leans back casually) So, yeah. Piece of cake. Just... avoid the coffee machines. And interpretive dance professors. And paper labyrinths. And Tuesdays between 2:07 and 2:11. Other than that? Smooth sailing.

Sam: (Face pale, crumples their form further) So... it's a bureaucratic nightmare fueled by existential dread and potentially evil appliances?

Max: (Grins) Precisely! Adds character, right? Builds resilience! Makes for a great story later! Now go forth, young padawan of strategic withdrawal! The Registrar's office awaits your... form. Try not to make eye contact with the photocopier. I hear it holds grudges.

### Why It Works (Probably)

   Relatability: Everyone who's been to college understands the pain of bureaucracy, bad classes, and advisors.
   Exaggeration: Takes common student anxieties and blows them up to absurd proportions (sentient coffee machines, interpretive dance lectures, quest-like forms).
   Persona: The humor comes from the contrast between the Narrator's confident, experienced facade and the chaotic reality of their actual experience. They are the least reliable narrator, but genuinely believe they are dispensing wisdom.
   Visual Gags: Interpretive dance lectures, paper labyrinth offices, exploding coffee machines provide great visual comedy potential.
   The Title: "Drop" works on multiple levels â€“ dropping a class, dropping expectations, dropping the ball, dropping something physically.

---

### Notes

   The specific absurd class name and professor method can be adjusted for maximum comedic effect.
   The obstacles in the bureaucratic gauntlet can be swapped out for other absurd campus hurdles (parking tickets, library fines, mandatory pointless seminars).
   The final physical "drop" (the form into the coffee) is the perfect ironic capstone to the story about dropping a class.
